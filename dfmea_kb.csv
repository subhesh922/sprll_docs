If considering plastic housing deformation, the actual compression ratio will be less than 40%.

The combination of 2 reasons:
(1)  Incorrect conclusion was drawn from the Tolerance Analysis (TA) study due to relevant dimensions reflected in the 2D drawing were incorrect.

 (2) Firefly terminal (USI): Because the PCB is installed into metal head with a tilt angle, the rubber is pinched between PCB and metal head boss, so the connector is about 0.20 lower than design.

2) Verify in the 3D model and TA, the compression of the Pogo pins when engaged is at 50% minimum.

3) For tilt installation, ensure adjacent area is free from risk of interference e.g., on SPR-4832 the design was updated to enlarge the opening at boss area to avoid pinching.
